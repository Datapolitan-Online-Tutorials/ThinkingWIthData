+ There's a lot of "cheerleading" for data
--

+ I'm assuming you've gotten a lot of these talks already
--

+ We don't often talk about why we aren't more data driven
--

+ My hope is to do that today

# Time for a Poll

+ Spreadsheets are powerful tools and widely used

+ Billions and billions of dollars are managed using spreadsheets. They may not be managed well but they are managed.
+ Federal Reserve policy is dictated by analysis done largely in spreadsheets. Not only the US market, but the entirity of the global financial system is run on spreadsheets
+ Key Lesson: We have the basic tools we need

+ A past student told me it was easier for her to go through the open data portal than another office in her own agency
+ We had some challenges with a support platform & this poor guy had to scrape through chat logs for performance data
+ We started with a gut feeling and then collected the data to prove what we knew was going on

+ The NYC Department of Transportation started an analysis unit staffed with parking meter collectors
+ They were the ones actually dodging traffic 
+ They had little training or experience but they figured out ways to get the analysis done because they wanted to know that if they were going to a meter, it was worth going to
+ Key lesson: people will find a way to accomplish the task of working with data

???
+ The inability to track and correlate work order requests digitally meant the NYC Parks department had little idea how much work really needed to be done
+ They couldn't provide accurate estimates to the elected leaders or the public
+ The failure to manage this well in regular time meant they were dramatically underprepared in a crisis
+ Key Lesson: leadership are just as affected by a lack of a data driven culture as those on the front lines

# So What Does This Culture Look Like?

---

# Some Key Beliefs
--

+ Data is a useful guide and should be used whenever possible
--

+ Everyone can use data and should have access to the tools and information they need to be successful
--

+ No one knows everything and we do this work better together

---

# Some Key Values
--

+ A single-source of reliable truth (centralized datastores, inspectible data cleaning processes, etc.) over distributed and differing information sources
--

+ Tested hypotheses over untested assumptions 
--
(and the ability to discern the difference)
--

+ Constant improvement in how things are measured, evaluated, and communicated

---

# Some Key Norms
--

+ Asking "what's the data on this tell us?"
--

+ Offering up data even when it's not explicitly asked for
--

+ Deferring judgement until the data is ready (if possible)
--

+ Answering questions without the data should feel uncomfortable or at least not be the norm

---

class:center,middle

# So Why Isn't this easier?

![img-center-80](images/data_idea.jpg)

---

# Line staff
--

+ Much of their **perceived** value is in their skill and knowledge
--

+ Their judgement is relied on for sound decision making
--

+ They often work in siloes and are respected for the work they do (no matter how inefficient)
--

+ People drawn to government work do so because often they value continuity and consistency
--

## They can feel pushed aside
---

# Leadership 
--

Leaders often attain their position because:
--

+ They were highly skilled and knowledgeable
--

+ Their judgement could be relied on for sound decision making
--

+ They were rewarded for knowing all the answers
--

+ They like being in control
--

## They can feel like they're losing control

---

class: center, middle
# Some thoughts on how to manage this change

---

# What NOT to do
--

+ Start the conversation telling colleagues what they "should" or "have to do" 
--
-> _Tell them what data will enable_
--

+ Tell them they need to measure everything 
--
-> _that will just lead to exhaustion if you aren't [measuring what matters](https://www.whatmatters.com/)_
--

+ Promise them everything will be solved with data 
--
-> _it won't and when it doesn't, you have even less support for being data driven than you started out with_

---

# Getting Buy-in 
--

+ Start small
--

+ Set a good example
--

+ Have tangible results
--

## The value of being more data-driven should be self-evident and speak for itself

---

# Getting Buy-in

We should be able to show a data-driven approach is:
--

+ more efficient
--

+ more reliable
--

+ provides repeatable results towards outcomes 
--

## If not, we may not be doing it right


---

# Getting Buy-in
--

+ Have patience 
--

+ Have empathy
--

+ Know this isn't easy work, but is important

---

# Final Thought
--

## Centering data more in our conversations is what can help us towards creating a more fair, equitable, and just society in which everyone benefits
--

> If we have data, let’s look at data. If all we have are opinions, let’s go with mine.

> + Jim Barksdale, former Netscape CEO


<!-- Good leaders not only get the **right tools** and the **right data** to the **right people** so they can provide results, but also take seriously their role in **reinforcing the culture of thinking with data** in all they do

A truly data-driven culture will value getting the right tools and the right data to the right people to achieve meaningful results that will be acted upon
