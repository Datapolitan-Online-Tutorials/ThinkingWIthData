# A data-driven culture will value getting the right tools and the right data to the right people to achieve results

---


# How to NOT Get Buy-in from Leadership
--

+ Start the conversation telling them what they "should" or "have to do"
--

+ Tell them they need to measure everything
--

+ Promise them everything will be solved with data

---

# How to Get Buy-in from Leadership (and everyone else)
--

+ Start small
--

+ Set a good example
--

+ Have tangible results
--

## The value of being more data-driven should be self-evident and speak for itself

---

# How to Get Buy-in from Leadership (and everyone else)
--

We should be able to show this approach is:
--

+ more efficient
--

+ more reliable
--

+ provides repeatable results towards outcomes
